		<h2> 11/03/2022 'Recap of Middle Man'</h2>
		
		<p>Woo! The websites finally up and now I have a chance to chat shit about what the band’s been upto.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		I wanna write this as posterity more than anything else. This is where we are, where I am, in this moment of time; and I think what we have going on is important enough
		(to us at least) to warrant writing down. Even if we fall apart within the year I kinda want something to be able to say ‘yeah, I did a thing, this is who we were’.<br>
		<br>
		These past few months leading up to the release of Middle Man have been both exciting and kinda terrifying? Which isn't really saying a lot for releasing a single, I’m just saying.
		 I’m gonna like start at the start and vaguely end up at the release of Middle Man and probably do the same for the rest of the songs, i.e. when they’re released I’ll go through the 
		 trials and tribulations of getting the band to do anything productive.<br>
		 <br>
		 Middle Man was my first experience in a real studio, I mean we’d recorded it in Eddys home studio where (because we’re children) we’d have to hold back our laughter whenever Cameron
		  was singing when we were right next to him and couldn't make a sound because of course that's totally hilarious. It was only really a problem when we could hear Eddy's dad singing or
		   something from the other room, which actually probably deserved to be a funny situation to laugh about, but anyway that version eventually got recorded just in time for covid to hit
		    and lockdowns to start and released for our ears only shortly after. I also did some vocal recording then and have only been told *now* how bad they were through Eddys uncomfortably
		     sensuous impressions of me. Back to the actual recording, it was a really neat experience, like walking in the first time with a big grin on my face, setting up and putting on the
		      big ole’ headphones, started playing through a lovely Fender Deluxe Reverb and still doing probably worse takes than I ever did in Eddys studio with my pedal board as a preamp
		       2 years earlier.<br>
		       <br>

		<p>Since then we’ve all been in every week for months now, me and Blaise went into it with very little recording experience but definitely improved since then. Still hurts when Eddy gets 
		nicknamed the human metronome and Cameron plays a sick guitar solo perfectly with the click though.<br>
		<br>
		This was around November/December 2021 and you could tell we were just getting the hang of recording to a professional standard. Four months to produce a single written at least two years 
		earlier isn't great, either way by January the fun stuff was over and we were on track to finally getting it out (I swear to god if I get a single sex joke about this), the art became the 
		next issue, of course no one could really agree on anything solid but Eddy pulled through and got us a pretty nice  a s t h e t i c  cover for the single. Except it was the wrong dimensions 
		and compressed to hell, we didn’t realise this till literally the '<a href="images/lightning-strike.webp" >day of distribution</a>' where our hearts were thoroughly broken over the fact we’d 
		have to do it all again. Or at least Eddy would, I didn’t really have too much to do with it.<br>
		<br>
		Before this we had a moment when I was signing us up for distribution services where we thought for nearly a week that we’d have to come up with a new name. <br>
		<br>
		Now, up until this point I’ve been understating our disagreements, and of course every band has this, It's just part of the labour of love that is making art with other people, but this of all 
		things made me want to actually rip my dick off. It’s because its something so minor that doesnt even impact the music too, if this was about something important in a song I’d at least feel like 
		the arguing was justified. At least with the album art like two or three of us could agree, with this it was like you’d suggest something and all anyone would do is disagree. And I get that I 
		probably contributed to this too but hey, hindsight; but it was like no one even have any like constructive criticism or anything, or just any actual criticism, you’d just get told ‘no’. 
		So uh, yeah the joy and pain I felt a few days later where I realise what Cameron said could be the thing that band falls apart on was easily fixable was real.<br>
		<br>
		Equally I vividly remember Saturday the 5th of Feburary, when I’m sat on my laptop playing video games and decide to check my emails ~5:30pm to see an email from the BBC. Up to that point I’d
		assumed that when Eddy set us up to be on BBC Introducing it wouldn’t be till the song had y’know, actually released. I wasn’t sure what to do, I thought about emailing them to say not to play
		it but I messaged the band and called everyone and we decided to go ahead. Since that night Cameron’s developed a habit of saying how much he loves us all and our proud of us he is. It was
		actually quite emotional though. I don’t think anythings really changed since we’ve been on the radio. I'm really proud of us of course, but that night the energy was insane. I’ve not had
		 a job for a few months now and I’m glad because no job could give the same amount of satisfaction and fulfilment as that. It was pretty emotional and felt like we’d really come a long way 
		 from being a few kids playing covers in pubs. It was years in the making and worth every second (not to be cheesy or anything).<br>
		 <br>
		 And then the song actually released on the 9th! We had a gig for this Battle of the Bands (Round two for us on the 13th of April at NE Volume if you’re interested. This is an advertisement. 
		 Yes I’m a shill.) the same night. So I turn up around 6pm with my laptop when the song was just releasing trying to cobble together a quick artists profile for Spotify at least  in the little 
		 VIP room for the bands before even thinking about going on stage, which was more stress than it was worth. So when I finally sorted that out and saw people starting to listen it was hella 
		 surreal. Still is to be honest. The energy that came off us that night was immense, like the other bands were amazing too and I did not go into it thinking we would win but I genuinely don’t 
		 think we’ve ever played as tight as we did on stage then. So then we only went and won it. I was stood next to a guy I only just met that night and he gave me this really big hug when it was 
		 announced that we won. I’m including that just because I appreciated it. I did fuck all the next day. Everyone else was buzzing, even Blaise seemed happy.<br>
		 <br>
		 I just wanna say a quick thank you to everyone in our lives that makes this happen, a massive shout out to Simon who has mentored and managed and supported us up to this point, we couldn't do 
		 it without you all. Also Nathan Robinson, thank you for helping making the website, you can check him out at <a href="http://roseberryprime.org" > http://roseberryprime.org</a>, hes incredibly smart and I don’t even begin to understand 
		 half the things he does.<br>
		 <br>
		 So yeah, that was Middle Man. Years in the making and currently making <em>me</em> sappy. Onwards and upwards.<br>
